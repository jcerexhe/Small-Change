<p>Howdy dudey,</p>
<p>We're chuffed that you made your own <a href="http://smallchangegiving.co/">Small Change account</a>.</p>
<p> We are trying to solve “slacktivism” or “Facebook Activism”. The humble like, share or retweet won’t fix the world’s problems. But Small Change can.</p>
<p>We put our Action Bar over any online content you want to share on social media. This gives your friends a simple means of taking action on the content you share, whether that be by donating small change to a related charity, or by signing a related petition.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.smallchangegiving.co/">your dashboard</a> where you can start a new campaign and track it as it grows.</p>

<p>Feel free to email me with any questions you have.</p>
<p> Much love </p>
<p>Sam</p><br>
